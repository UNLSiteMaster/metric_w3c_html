This error means that there is a `<p>` element on the page with an `align` attribute.  The `align` attribute has been removed from the HTML specification in favor of using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which abstracts the presentation of the page from the structure (HTML) of the page.  Use CSS instead.

The following example is **not valid**:

```
<p align="center">
    foo
</p>
```

The following example **is valid**, but is not encouraged because it still does not fully abstract presentation from HTML:

```
<p style="text-align: center;">
    foo
</p>
```

The following example **is valid**, and **is recommended**. It uses a CSS `class` to make the presentation reusable and to separate the CSS from the HTML.

```
<head>
    <!-- It would be even better to include this style as a .css file -->
    <style>
       .centered {
           text-align: center;
       }
    </style>
</head>

...

<p class="centered">
    foo
</p>

```
