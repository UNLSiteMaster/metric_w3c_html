This error means that there are unencoded ampersands (&) in your markup.  HTML uses the ampersand character to start a character reference, and is thus a reserved symbol.  Instead of typing `&`, type the character reference `&amp;` instead.

The following example is **not valid** because it does not use a character reference:

```
today & tomorrow
```

The following example **is valid** because it uses a character reference

```
today &amp; tomorrow
```
