This error means that there are unencoded ampersands (&) in your markup.  HTML uses the ampersand character to start a character reference, and is thus a reserved symbol.  Instead of typing `&`, type the character reference `&amp;` instead.


The following example is **not valid** because it does not use a character reference:

```
http://www.example.com/?q=test&test
```

The following example will throw a notice because it does not use a character reference:

```
today & tomorrow
```

The following example **is valid** because it uses character references

```
today &amp; tomorrow
http://www.example.com/?q=test&amp;test
```
