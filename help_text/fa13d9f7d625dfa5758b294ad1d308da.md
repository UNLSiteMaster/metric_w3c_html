This error means that there is an image (`img`) element on the page without an `alt` attribute.  An `alt` attribute should contain alternative text for the image in cases where the image can not be presented.  Some examples of these cases are when the image does not load or when the page is read with a screen reader for the visually impaired.

See [http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/](http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for details on how to use the `alt` attribute for different types of images.  Another useful reference is the [alt decision tree](http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)

The following example is **not valid**:

```
<img src="image.jpg" />

```

The following example **is valid**

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="a turtle eating some fruit" />

```

The following example is **is valid** ONLY if the image purely decorative (the purpose of the image is not to convey information that is important to understanding the page)

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="" />

```
