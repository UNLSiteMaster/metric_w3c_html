This error means that there is a `<font>` element in the markup of the page. Please remove this element from the page and use CSS styling instead.

The `<font>` element was originally introduced as a way to style text. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was introduced later to provide a way to abstract presentation markup from the structural (HTML) markup. CSS is now preferred and the `<font>` element has been removed from the HTML standard. Although some browsers still support it, the element can not be relied upon.

The following example is **not valid**:

```
<p><font size="5" color="blue">foo</font></p>

```

The following example **is valid**, but not encouraged because it does not fully abstract presentational code from html markup:

```
<p style="font-size:5em; color:blue;">foo</p>

```

The following example **is valid**, and recommended.  It uses a CSS `class` to make the presentation reusable.

```
<head>
    <!-- It would be even better to include this style as a .css file -->
    <style>
       .bar {
           font-size:5em;
           color:blue;
       }
    </style>
</head>

...

<p class="bar">foo</p>

```
